4. **Architecture Assessment (25%)** - Design patterns, scalability, and infrastructure architecture

#### Rating Scale

| Rating | Description | Action Required |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Compliant (Excellent)** | 90-100% | Maintain current standards |
| **Compliant (Good)** | 70-89% | Minor improvements recommended |
| **Non-Compliant (Major)** | 40-69% | Significant improvements required |
| **Non-Compliant (Critical)** | 0-39% | Immediate action required |
| **Not Applicable** | N/A | Parameter doesn't apply to current context |

#### Parameter Types

- **Required Parameters** - Essential for baseline compliance (included in rating calculations)
- **Optional Parameters** - Enhanced features for mature implementations (excluded from rating calculations)
- **Context-Dependent** - May be required/optional based on project type

### Rating Calculation Formula

```
Section Compliance = (Compliant Required Parameters / Total Required Parameters) × 100
Overall Compliance = Average of all Section Compliance ratings
```

**Example Calculation:**

```text
Repository Structure: 9 compliant out of 10 required = 9/10 × 100 = 90%
Security: 5 compliant out of 6 required = 5/6 × 100 = 83%
Code Quality: 4 compliant out of 5 required = 4/5 × 100 = 80%
Architecture: 6 compliant out of 7 required = 6/7 × 100 = 86%
Overall: (90 + 83 + 80 + 86) / 4 = 85%
```

### Customizing This Assessment

#### Adding New Parameters

1. **Identify the appropriate section** (Structure, Security, Quality, Architecture)
2. **Define the parameter clearly** with specific criteria
3. **Assign severity level** (Critical, Major, Minor) based on impact
4. **Mark as Required or Optional** based on team needs
5. **Update the calculation** if adding required parameters

**Example Addition:**
```markdown
| **API Versioning Strategy** | Non-Compliant (Major) | No API versioning implemented. | Implement semantic versioning for APIs. |
```

#### Removing Parameters

1. **Mark parameter as "Not Applicable"** instead of removing entirely
2. **Update calculation** if removing required parameters
3. **Document rationale** for exclusion in remarks
4. **Consider moving to Optional** rather than complete removal

#### Modifying Parameter Severity

Change severity levels based on your organization's priorities:

```markdown
# Change from:
| **Security Scanning** | Non-Compliant (Critical) | ... |

# To (if less critical for your context):
| **Security Scanning (Optional)** | Non-Compliant (Minor) | ... |
```

#### Customizing for Different Project Types

**Infrastructure Projects:**
- Keep all Terraform/IaC parameters as Required
- Mark application-specific parameters as Optional
- Add cloud-specific security requirements

**Application Projects:**
- Mark infrastructure parameters as Optional
- Emphasize code quality and testing parameters
- Add language-specific standards

**Documentation Projects:**
- Focus on Repository Structure parameters
- Mark technical implementation parameters as Optional
- Emphasize documentation quality metrics

### Assessment Frequency Recommendations

| Project Phase | Assessment Frequency | Focus Areas |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Initial Setup** | Before first deployment | Repository Structure, Basic Security |
| **Development** | Monthly or per sprint | Code Quality, Security Implementation |
| **Pre-Production** | Before each release | All categories, focus on Critical items |
| **Production** | Quarterly | Ongoing compliance, Optional enhancements |

### Using Assessment Results

#### Priority Matrix

| Severity | Compliance Level | Action |
|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Critical | <40% | **Immediate Fix Required** - Block deployment |
| Major | 40-69% | **Plan for Next Sprint** - Address in next iteration |
| Minor | 70-89% | **Backlog Item** - Address when resources allow |
| Optional | Any | **Enhancement** - Implement for maturity |

#### Creating Action Plans

1. **Group by Priority Level** - Address Critical items first
2. **Estimate Effort** - Assign story points or time estimates
3. **Assign Ownership** - Designate responsible team members
4. **Set Deadlines** - Based on deployment timelines
5. **Track Progress** - Regular reassessment and updates

### Report Maintenance

#### Keeping the Assessment Current

- **Review parameters quarterly** - Add new industry standards
- **Update based on lessons learned** - Adjust weights and requirements
- **Incorporate organizational changes** - Reflect new policies or tools
- **Validate with teams** - Ensure parameters remain relevant

#### Version Control

- **Tag assessment versions** - Track changes over time
- **Document modifications** - Maintain change log
- **Baseline comparisons** - Track improvement trends
- **Archive old versions** - Maintain historical perspective

## Repository Patterns and Naming Conventions

### 1. Module Repository
Definition: The smallest, reusable unit (e.g., VNet, subnet, storage account).
Purpose: Encapsulates a single resource or function, designed for maximum reusability and composability.
Best Practices:
- Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.2.3) for releases.
- Keep modules generic, well-documented, and independently testable.
Naming pattern:
`module-<tooling>-<provider>-<service>-<resource>`
Example: `module-tf-azurerm-storage-container`

### 2. Component Repository
Definition: Aggregates multiple modules to deliver a higher-level resource (e.g., a VM with networking, disks, monitoring, and security).
Purpose: Encapsulates orchestration logic and cross-module dependencies for complex resources that require tight integration.
Best Practices:
- Use only when multiple modules must always be deployed together.
- Maintain clear, minimal orchestration logic to avoid monolithic components.
Naming pattern:
`component-tf-<resource>`
Example: `component-tf-linux-virtual-machine`

### 3. Solution Repository
Definition: The top-level repo for an environment or application, referencing modules and/or components to deliver complete infrastructure.
Purpose:
- Contains environment definitions for a project (e.g., development, staging, production).
- References modules and/or components via repository URLs and specific tags, ensuring stability and repeatability.
- Supports infrastructure deployment workflows and automation pipelines.
Best Practices:
- Use a consistent prefix for related resources (e.g., all resources for a project in the same resource group).
- Include environment and application names to differentiate between stages (dev, test, prod) and applications.
- Be mindful of character limits and naming restrictions of the underlying cloud provider.
Naming pattern:
`solution-<tooling>-<provider>-<org/project>-<env/app>-<resource>`
Example: `solution-tf-azure-frow-digops-managed-grafana`
